# OpenGL Model Loader

This project demonstrates a basic OpenGL renderer with support for loading 3D models using **Assimp**. The core functionality revolves around **Model** and **Mesh** classes that handle the loading, processing, and rendering of 3D assets.

## Features

- **Model class**  
  Handles loading of 3D models via Assimp, including all meshes and textures.

- **Mesh class**  
  Encapsulates mesh data (vertices, indices, textures) and provides methods to render the mesh efficiently using OpenGL.

- **Texture loading**  
  Supports diffuse, specular, normal, and height maps.

- **Shader integration**  
  Meshes can be rendered with customizable shaders.
